Battery Management System (BMS) - Brief Description
Batteries play a crucial role in modern applications, but their efficiency and lifespan are affected by overheating, imbalances, and improper charging. This project aims to develop an advanced Battery Management System (BMS) that provides real-time monitoring of key battery parameters—voltage, temperature, and current—to optimize performance and enhance safety.

Key Features:

Real-Time Monitoring:
  Temperature Measurement: Uses an NTC thermistor to detect battery temperature, ensuring safe operation.
  Voltage Monitoring: Implements a voltage divider circuit to measure battery voltage.
  Current Sensing: Utilizes an analog sensor to calculate battery current.
  
Circuit & PCB Design:
  Designed using KiCAD, integrating voltage, current, and temperature sensing circuits.
  Optimized component placement and routing to prevent signal interference and short circuits.  
  PCB fabrication and assembly for a compact and efficient system.
  
Data Transmission & Mobile App Integration:
  Uses MQTT protocol for seamless data transfer to a cloud platform.
  Implements MIT App Inventor to develop a mobile application that displays battery parameters in real time.
  Enables remote monitoring and alerts, enhancing battery safety and longevity.
